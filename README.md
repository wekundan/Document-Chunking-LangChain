# 📘 Document Chunking with LangChain & OpenAI

This project demonstrates how to split large documents into smaller, meaningful chunks using **LangChain** and **OpenAI**.  
Chunking is an essential step in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), chatbots, and document-based Q&A systems, as it allows LLMs to efficiently process and retrieve relevant information.

##  Features
- Uses LangChain's `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` and other splitters
- Demonstrates chunking with different strategies
- Prepares text for embeddings and retrieval
- Jupyter Notebook walkthrough for hands-on learning
